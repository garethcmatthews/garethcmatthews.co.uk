    <h6>JOB APPLICATIONS/ROLE ENQUIRIES:</h6>
    <p>If you have received my details from a JOB AGENT/AGENCY that has provided proof to you that they have my permission to represent me for the advertised role, then you should forward all communications via the AGENT rather than contact me via this site. Trying to bypass approved Job Agents annoys them and is unhelpful for all involved parties.</p>
